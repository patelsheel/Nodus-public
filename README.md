## 💡 Philosophy

Nodus Status was created to fill the gap between overcomplicated network tools and vague status indicators. It's:
- **Private**: No data ever leaves your machine.
- **Transparent**: Everything visible and easy to understand.
- **Minimal**: Clean UI with a focused and distraction-free design.
